## About the Project

### Purpose

<p>This is a Django-powered web application that manages the backend operations for booking and managing wine-tasting events. It handles user authentication, event scheduling, and booking management. The backend ensures seamless data flow between the database and the user interface, providing a robust platform for wine enthusiasts to explore and book immersive tasting experiences.</p>


### Target Audience

The primary target audiences include:
- **Wine Enthusiasts**: Individuals who have a passion for wine and are looking for new and exciting tasting experiences.
- **Event Organisers**: Businesses and individuals who organise wine-tasting events and need a platform to manage bookings and user interactions.
- **Restaurant Owners**: Establishments that host wine-tasting events and want to offer their customers a unique and memorable experience.

### Data

We manage different types of data to ensure a smooth and personalised experience:
- **User Data**: Information related to user registration, login, and profile management. This includes usernames, passwords, email addresses, and profile details.
- **Event Data**: Details about the wine-tasting events, such as event titles, descriptions, dates, times, and available spots.
- **Booking Data**: Information about user bookings, including the number of spots reserved, booking dates, and associated wine-tasting events.

### Security Features

Security is a critical part of the project. Several measures have been implemented for the safety and privacy of user data:
- **User Authentication**: The application uses Django's built-in authentication system to manage user registration and login securely.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as passwords, are encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
- **CSRF Protection**: (CSRF) is enabled to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security are used to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring secure communication.
- **Session Management**: Secure session cookies are used to manage user sessions, with settings to prevent session hijacking and fixation.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control is implemented to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-bar-experience.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd wine-bar-experience
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
4. Install the dependencies:

## Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku

Follow these steps to deploy the Wine Bar Experience Django project to Heroku.

### Create the Heroku App

1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab and reveal the config vars. Add a key of `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` and a value of `1`, then click **Add**.

### Update Your Code for Deployment

3. Install a production-ready web server for Heroku:
    ```sh
    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
    ```

4. Add `gunicorn` to the [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file:
    ```sh
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create a file named [Procfile](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) at the root directory of the project (same directory as [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)):
    ```sh
    echo "web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi" > Procfile
    ```

6. Open the `my_project/settings.py` file and replace `DEBUG=True` with `DEBUG=False`:
    ```python
    DEBUG = False
    ```

7. Also, in `settings.py`, append the Heroku hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com']
    ```

8. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Deploy on Heroku

9. Return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the **Deploy** tab.

10. In the **Deployment method** section, enable GitHub integration by clicking on **Connect to GitHub**.

11. Search for your project repo name and click **Search**. Select the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.

12. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Deploy Branch** to start a manual deployment of the main branch.

13. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

14. Open the **Resources** tab and choose an eco dyno. This dyno is a lightweight container to run your project.

15. Verify there is no existing Postgres database add-on in the **Resources** tab. If there is one, you can destroy it to avoid usage costs.

16. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

Your Wine Bar Experience Django project should now be successfully deployed on Heroku.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: The primary web framework used for building the backend of the application. It handles user authentication, event scheduling, and booking management.
  
- **Gunicorn**: A production-ready web server for running the Django application on Heroku.
  
- **Heroku**: The platform used for deploying the application.

<hr>

- **SQLite**: The database used for development. It stores user data, event details, and booking information.

<hr>

- **Whitenoise**: A Python package that helps serve static files in a Django application.


### What is WhiteNoise

WhiteNoise is a Python package that helps serve static files in a Django application. It is particularly useful in production environments where you need a reliable and efficient way to serve static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

#### Key Benefits of WhiteNoise:

1. **Simplifies Static File Handling**: WhiteNoise allows your Django application to serve its own static files, eliminating the need for a separate web server or CDN for static assets.
   
2. **Efficient Caching**: It provides efficient caching mechanisms, including support for cache headers and compression, which can improve the performance of your site.
   
3. **Easy Integration**: WhiteNoise integrates seamlessly with Django, requiring minimal configuration changes.
   
4. **Security**: It helps ensure that static files are served securely, with appropriate headers to prevent issues like MIME type sniffing.

### To use WhiteNoise:

1. **Install WhiteNoise**:
    ```sh
    pip install whitenoise
    ```

2. **Add WhiteNoise to Middleware**:
    Add `WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in your `settings.py` file, preferably right after `SecurityMiddleware`:
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
        "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
    ]
    ```

3. **Collect Static Files**:
    Run the `collectstatic` command to gather all static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory:
    ```sh
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

By following these steps, WhiteNoise will handle your static files efficiently and securely.

<hr>
  
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the frontend of the application.
  
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the frontend, including dynamic updates and immersive projections.
  
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for responsive design and styling.
  
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the Django application.
  
- **Git**: Version control system used for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
  
- **GitHub**: The platform used for hosting the project's repository and integrating with Heroku for deployment.

## Testing

To ensure that the Wine Bar Experience application is working correctly, follow these steps to run tests and verify the functionality of the app.

### Running Tests

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd wine-bar-experience
    ```

2. **Run Django Tests**:
    Django comes with a built-in testing framework. You can run the tests using the following command:
    ```sh
    python manage.py test
    ```

3. **Check Test Coverage**:
    To check the test coverage, you can use the `coverage` package. First, install it if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    pip install coverage
    ```

    Then, run the tests with coverage:
    ```sh
    coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
    ```

    Finally, generate a coverage report:
    ```sh
    coverage report
    ```
