    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
4. Install the dependencies:

## Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku

Follow these steps to deploy the Wine Bar Experience Django project to Heroku.

### Create the Heroku App

1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab and reveal the config vars. Add a key of `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` and a value of `1`, then click **Add**.

### Update Your Code for Deployment

3. Install a production-ready web server for Heroku:
    ```sh
    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
    ```

4. Add `gunicorn` to the [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file:
    ```sh
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create a file named [Procfile](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) at the root directory of the project (same directory as [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)):
    ```sh
    echo "web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi" > Procfile
    ```

6. Open the `my_project/settings.py` file and replace `DEBUG=True` with `DEBUG=False`:
    ```python
    DEBUG = False
    ```

7. Also, in `settings.py`, append the Heroku hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com']
    ```

8. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Deploy on Heroku

9. Return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the **Deploy** tab.

10. In the **Deployment method** section, enable GitHub integration by clicking on **Connect to GitHub**.

11. Search for your project repo name and click **Search**. Select the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.

12. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Deploy Branch** to start a manual deployment of the main branch.

13. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

14. Open the **Resources** tab and choose an eco dyno. This dyno is a lightweight container to run your project.

15. Verify there is no existing Postgres database add-on in the **Resources** tab. If there is one, you can destroy it to avoid usage costs.

16. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

Your Wine Bar Experience Django project should now be successfully deployed on Heroku.
