## About the Project

### Purpose

<p>This is a Django-powered web application that manages the backend operations for booking and managing wine-tasting events. It handles user authentication, event scheduling, and booking management. The backend ensures seamless data flow between the database and the user interface, providing a robust platform for wine enthusiasts to explore and book immersive tasting experiences.</p>


### Target Audience

The primary target audiences include:
- **Wine Enthusiasts**: Individuals who have a passion for wine and are looking for new and exciting tasting experiences.
- **Event Organisers**: Businesses and individuals who organise wine-tasting events and need a platform to manage bookings and user interactions.
- **Restaurant Owners**: Establishments that host wine-tasting events and want to offer their customers a unique and memorable experience.

### Data

We manage different types of data to ensure a smooth and personalised experience:
- **User Data**: Information related to user registration, login, and profile management. This includes usernames, passwords, email addresses, and profile details.
- **Event Data**: Details about the wine-tasting events, such as event titles, descriptions, dates, times, and available spots.
- **Booking Data**: Information about user bookings, including the number of spots reserved, booking dates, and associated wine-tasting events.

### Security Features

Security is a critical part of the project. Several measures have been implemented for the safety and privacy of user data:
- **User Authentication**: The application uses Django's built-in authentication system to manage user registration and login securely.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as passwords, are encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
- **CSRF Protection**: (CSRF) is enabled to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security are used to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring secure communication.
- **Session Management**: Secure session cookies are used to manage user sessions, with settings to prevent session hijacking and fixation.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control is implemented to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

## Design Section

This section outlines the design process and decisions for "The Wine Bar," an online booking system for wine-tasting events. The design blends elegance with usability, creating a wine-inspired experience rooted in UX principles.

### Wireframes
Below are conceptual wireframes for key pages, designed to ensure usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Homepage**  
  - Layout: Header with navigation bar (Home, events, Register/ login), hero section with a welcome message.
    
  - Purpose: Quick access to bookings, register and login. 
   
  <img src="static/media/readme/landing_page.jpg" alt="home page" width="400px" margin=" 0 auto"/>
<br>

- **Booking Page**  
  - Layout: Compact form with fields for date, time, and party size, plus a "Book Now" button. There is a simple model to complete the booking.
   
  - Purpose: Streamlined booking process for mobile/ desktop users.   
  
  <img src="static/media/readme/booking.jpg" alt="home page" width="400px" margin=" 0 auto"/>
<br>

- **Profile Page**  
  - Layout: A simple layout with user information (name, email, contact number). There is also a section on the page for the booked events (They can edit or cancel booking from here). 
  
  - Purpose: All the required information the user needs in one place. (Also updates admin side)
  
  <img src="static/media/readme/profile.jpg" alt="home page" width="400px" margin=" 0 auto"/>
<br> 

- **Admin Panel**  
  - Layout: The use of the Django admin panel is all I need for this project.   

  - Purpose: Easy management of booking and users records.

### Color Scheme
The color palette is defined in the CSS `:root` variables, inspired by wine culture and designed for contrast and readability:
- **Primary Text Color**: `rgb(243, 243, 243)` (#F3F3F3, Light White) - Main text for legibility against dark backgrounds.  
- **Secondary Text Color**: `rgb(187, 187, 187)` (#BBBBBB, Light Gray) - Subtle text variations (e.g., labels or secondary info).  
- **Tertiary Text Color**: `rgb(152, 152, 152)` (#989898, Medium Gray) - Additional hierarchy for less prominent text.  
- **Alert Text Color**: `rgb(211, 25, 44)` (#D3192C, Bright Red) - Error messages or alerts (e.g., form validation).  
- **Gold Accent**: `#ffc107` (Golden Yellow) - Highlights buttons and key actions/ areas, evoking premium wine quality.  
- **Primary Background**: `rgba(71, 71, 71, 0.9)` (#474747 with 90% opacity, Dark Gray) - Main content background with a sleek, semi-transparent look.  
- **Secondary Background**: `rgba(21, 21, 21, 0.9)` (#151515 with 90% opacity, Near Black) - Deeper contrast for headers or overlays.  
- **Text Shadow**: `1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)` - Subtle shadow for text to enhance readability on varied backgrounds.

### Typography
Typography is defined in the `body` CSS, prioritizing a refined and thematic aesthetic:
- **Font Family**: `'Della Respira', serif` - A serif font with a classic, elegant feel, reminiscent of wine labels and vintage charm.  
- **Letter Spacing**: `1px` - Adds subtle spacing for improved readability and a polished look.

### Design Rationale
The design ties functionality to a cohesive wine-tasting theme:
- **Navigation**: Intuitive menu labels ("Home, Wine Celler, Register, Uncork Access") ensure easy access to core features.  
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across devices, with forms and tables optimized for all screen sizes.  
- **Theme**: A fixed background image (`empty_glasses.jpg`) of empty wine glasses, styled with `background-size: cover`, `background-repeat: no-repeat`, and `background-position: center`, sets a sophisticated tone. Dark semi-transparent backgrounds (`--bg-color`, `--bg-color2`) overlay this image, ensuring content readability while maintaining the wine aesthetic. The `--gold-color` accents buttons, and `--text-color` (light white) ensures text stands out.  
- **User Interaction**: Interactive elements (e.g., "Book Now" button) use `--gold-color` for prominence, while `--text-alert` provides clear error feedback. The `'Della Respira'` font enhances the wine-cellar vibe, with `1px` letter spacing adding refinement.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku

Follow these steps to deploy the Wine Bar Experience Django project to Heroku.

### Create the Heroku App

1. Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.

2. Click on the **Settings** tab and reveal the config vars. Add a key of `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` and a value of `1`, then click **Add**.

### Update Your Code for Deployment

3. Install a production-ready web server for Heroku:
    ```sh
    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
    ```

4. Add `gunicorn` to the [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file:
    ```sh
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create a file named [Procfile](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) at the root directory of the project (same directory as [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)):
    ```sh
    echo "web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi" > Procfile
    ```

6. Open the `my_project/settings.py` file and replace `DEBUG=True` with `DEBUG=False`:
    ```python
    DEBUG = False
    ```

7. Also, in `settings.py`, append the Heroku hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com']
    ```

8. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Deploy on Heroku

9. Return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the **Deploy** tab.

10. In the **Deployment method** section, enable GitHub integration by clicking on **Connect to GitHub**.

11. Search for your project repo name and click **Search**. Select the GitHub repo you want to deploy from.

12. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Deploy Branch** to start a manual deployment of the main branch.

13. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

14. Open the **Resources** tab and choose an eco dyno. This dyno is a lightweight container to run your project.

15. Verify there is no existing Postgres database add-on in the **Resources** tab. If there is one, you can destroy it to avoid usage costs.

16. Click on **Open app** to view your deployed project.

Your Wine Bar Experience Django project should now be successfully deployed on Heroku.

- **Whitenoise**: A Python package that helps serve static files in a Django application.


### What is WhiteNoise

WhiteNoise is a Python package that helps serve static files in a Django application. It is particularly useful in production environments where you need a reliable and efficient way to serve static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

#### Key Benefits of WhiteNoise:

1. **Simplifies Static File Handling**: WhiteNoise allows your Django application to serve its own static files, eliminating the need for a separate web server or CDN for static assets.
   
2. **Efficient Caching**: It provides efficient caching mechanisms, including support for cache headers and compression, which can improve the performance of your site.
   
3. **Easy Integration**: WhiteNoise integrates seamlessly with Django, requiring minimal configuration changes.
   
4. **Security**: It helps ensure that static files are served securely, with appropriate headers to prevent issues like MIME type sniffing.

### To use WhiteNoise:

1. **Install WhiteNoise**:
    ```sh
    pip install whitenoise
    ```

2. **Add WhiteNoise to Middleware**:
    Add `WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in your `settings.py` file, preferably right after `SecurityMiddleware`:
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
        "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware",
    ]
    ```

3. **Collect Static Files**:
    Run the `collectstatic` command to gather all static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory:
    ```sh
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

By following these steps, WhiteNoise will handle your static files efficiently and securely.

## Credits

The Wine Bar Experience project was inspired by the need to create a unique and immersive platform for wine enthusiasts. The project structure and layouts were created by me, but I used various resources to help me build the application:

- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/): For learning about Django functions and libraries.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): For providing a responsive design framework and styling components.
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/): For generating code snippets and suggestions.


### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentor, **Rory Patrick Sheridan**, for his guidance and support throughout the project. I would also like to thank the Code Institute tutors for their help and feedback.

This project was a great learning experience and I'm excited to share it with others.

## Recent Changes and Improvements

This section summarises updates to the code and documentation addressing the feedback from the project's first submission.

**Pass Criteria**

- **Design Documentation Added (Criterion 1.13)**  
  I added a [Design Section](#design-section) section to the README, featuring placeholders for wireframes of key pages (Homepage, Booking Page, Admin Panel), the wine-inspired color scheme from `:root` CSS variables, typography (`'Della Respira', serif`), and a design rationale tied to the `empty_glasses.jpg` background. This documents the UX-driven, responsive design process and thematic choices, fulfilling the requirement for mockups and design specifications.

- **Secured Sensitive Information (Criteria 5.2 & 6.4)**  
  Removed the hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` from the backend settings, which was previously visible in the repository and settings file. It is now stored as an environment variable in a `.env` file for local development and configured in Heroku‚Äôs environment variables for production. This ensures sensitive data is not exposed in the codebase, aligning with security best practices.

- **Environment Variable Management (Criterion 5.2)**  
  Updated the codebase to prevent environment variable values from being visible in the repository. All sensitive configuration (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials) is now loaded dynamically via environment variables, improving security and maintainability.

- **Database Upgrade (Criterion 6.4)**  
  Replaced `db.sqlite3` in production with PostgreSQL to support scalability, performance, and concurrent user access. Updated the README deployment steps to include PostgreSQL setup for both local and Heroku environments, replacing the less robust SQLite solution.

- **DEBUG Mode Disabled (Criterion 6.4)**  
  Set `DEBUG = False` in production settings to prevent sensitive information exposure, with `DEBUG = True` retained only for local development via environment-specific configurations.

**Merit Criteria**

- **Profile Deletion Functionality Fixed (Criterion 1.1 & 2.1)**  
  Repaired the broken profile deletion feature, which previously redirected to a form with "None" fields and an error. Added a "Delete Profile" button in `profile.html` with a Bootstrap modal for confirmation. The `profile` view now processes the `delete_profile` POST request, deleting the `User` and `UserProfile` objects, logging out the user, and redirecting to the wine cellar page (`bookings:wine_cellar`) with a success message, ensuring seamless account management.

- **Added Unit Tests (Criterion 4.1)**  
  Added unit tests in `bookings/tests.py` for `WineCellar`, `UserProfile`, and `Booking` models, covering creation, custom methods (e.g., `has_available_spots`, `save`), and signal behavior. Also tested the `profile` view for loading, updates, and deletion, and added tests for `UserProfileForm` and `wine_list` view. Fixed test failures by adjusting `UserProfile` creation in tests to avoid duplicate entries and updated the signal to sync `User` email. I generated a new coverage report improving coverage from 53% to 81%.

**Side Note**

- **Custom 404 Error Page**
  
  As part of this resubmission, I've implemented a custom 404 error page that:

  - Maintains the site's wine-themed design aesthetic
  - Provides clear navigation back to the home page
  - Improves user experience by handling errors gracefully
  - Adds professionalism to the overall site architecture

These changes enhance security by safeguarding sensitive data, improve scalability with a production-ready database, and provide comprehensive design documentation. The use of version control remains efficient with descriptive commits.
